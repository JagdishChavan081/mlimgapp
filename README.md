# Machine Learning-based Image Classification Web App

* Welcome to Deploy End to End Machine Learning-based Image Classification Web App in Cloud Platform from scratch.

Image Processing & classification is one of the areas of Data Science and has a wide variety of applications in the industries in the current world. Many industries looking for a Data Scientist with these skills. This project covers modeling techniques for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, tuning, and production.

We start the project by learning **Scikit Image for image processing** which is the essential skill required and then we will do the necessary **preprocessing techniques & feature extraction** to an image like **HOG.**

In this project we will learn how to label the images, image data preprocessing and analysis using scikit image and python.

Then we will train machine learning here we will see **Stochastic Gradient Descenct Classifier** for image classification and followed by model evaluation proces and pipeline the machine learning model.

After that we will create **web app** in **Flask** by rendering **HTML, CSS, Boostrap**. Then, we finally deploy web app in Python Anywhere which is cloud platform.

**Requirements**

* Python

* Scikit Image

* Data Preprocessing

* HOG

* Base Estimator and TransformerMixIn

* SGD Classifier

* Create and Make Pipeline Model

* Hyperparameter Tuning

* Flask

* HTTP methods

* Deploy in PythonAnywhere

**We know that the Image Classification Flask Web App is one of those topics that always leaves some doubts. Feel free to ask question, we are happy to answer you question.**
